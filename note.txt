go run main.go 

Best practice: 
 Define variable as "local" as possible
 Create the variable where you need it

Local Variables:
 Define inside a function or a block
 They can be accessed only inside that function or block of code

Readable code -> Encapsulated the logic which belongs together:
 Greet user --> greetUsers()
 Get user input --> getUserInput()
 Validate user input --> validateUserInput()
 check if data valid 
 Booking ticket --> bookTicket()
 Get first names --> getFirstNames()
 Print frist names 
 If no tickets left, exit program

More Use Cases of Functions:
 Group logic that belongs together
 Reuse logic and so reducing duplication of code 
  Ex: Define variable once and reuse it many times 
      Validate user input in different city
