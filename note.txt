for 1 main file: go run main.go 
for many files, ex: 
    1. go rum main.go helper.go
    2. go run . 

Go programs are organized into packages

A package is a collection of Go files 

Scope: Package Level (Variables and Functions defined outside any function, can be accessed in all other files within the same package)

Best practice: 
 Define variable as "local" as possible
 Create the variable where you need it

Local Variables:
 Define inside a function or a block
 They can be accessed only inside that function or block of code

Readable code -> Encapsulated the logic which belongs together:
 Greet user --> greetUsers()
 Get user input --> getUserInput()
 Validate user input --> validateUserInput()
 check if data valid 
 Booking ticket --> bookTicket()
 Get first names --> getFirstNames()
 Print frist names 
 If no tickets left, exit program

More Use Cases of Functions:
 Group logic that belongs together
 Reuse logic and so reducing duplication of code 
  Ex: Define variable once and reuse it many times 
      Validate user input in different city


Multiple Packages in your application, ex:
    main package: main.go, helper.go 
    inventory package: invent1.go, invent2.go 
    ui package: ui1.go, ui2.go, ui3.go 

Put every packages in its folder with the same name with the package

Import another function from another package if we want to use it. Import package from root module. In this case, root module is "booking-app"

Exporting a variable or function by Capitalize first letter: 
    Make it avaiable for all packages in the app 

3 Levels of Scope:
    1. Local (only be used within that function or block code): 
        declaration within function
        declaration within block (e.g. for, if-else)
    2. Package (can be used everywhere in the same package):
        declaration outside all functions
    3. Global (can be used everywhere across all packages):
        declaration outsid all functions & uppercase first letter 


Maps 
    All keys have the same data type 
    All values have the same data type

    Contoh:
        var mySlice []string 
        var mayMap map[string]string

Creating a slice with "make"
    Alternatie way to creat a slice 
    We need to define the initial size of the slice 


Iterating over a list of string:

pemesanan = ["John Doe", "Jane Smith"]

Element is a string: "John Doe" 


Iterating over a list of map:

pemesanan = [
    {namaDepan: "John", namaBelakang: "Doe"}
    {namaDepan: "Jane", namaBelakang: "Smith"}
]

Element si a map: {namaDepan: "John", namaBelakang: "Doe"}


Struct or Structure : can hold mixed data types 

"type" statement - Custome Types 
    The type keyword creates a new type, with the name you specify
    In fact, you could also creat a type based on every other data type like int, string, etc.

Defining a structure:
    Mixed data type 
    Defining a structure (which fields) of the User Type 
    It's like a lightweight class in other program languanges, which e.g. doesn't support inheritance

"time" - functionality for time 
    The sleep function stops or blocks the current "thread" (goroutine) execution for the defined duration 

"go" keyword:
    "go ..." - starts a new goroutine
    A goroutine is a lightweight thread managed by the Go run time 

Waitgroup
    waits for the launched goroutine to finish
    Package "sync" provides synchronization functionality
    Add: Sets the number of goroutines to wait for(increases the counter by the provided number)
    Wait: Blocks until the Waitgroup counter is 0 
    Done: Decrements the Waitgroup counter by 1. So this is called by the goroutine to indicate that it's finished
